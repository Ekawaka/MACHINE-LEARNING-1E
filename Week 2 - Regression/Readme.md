Blueberry Yield â€“ Zindua ML Week 2 Challenge

The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Wild blueberry Yield Prediction Dataset. (Since this is Playground 3.14, it seems like we need a Blueberry Pie joke here?) Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

Files

train.csv - the training dataset; yield is the target.

test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the yield given the other features.

sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format.
